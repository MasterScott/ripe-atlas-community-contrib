# RIPE Atlas Community Contrib

(Collection of links to other tools)

In the main repository are contributions by the community of the RIPE Atlas
visualizations, tools for analysing measurements data.  

Below are the links to other independantly hosted projects:

  A set of Python command-line scripts and library for issuing measurements to the RIPE Atlas network.

* **[GoogleEarth visualizaiton for RIPE Atlas traceroutes](https://github.com/mathias4github/ripe-atlas-traceroute2kml)** 
  A Python script which reads results from RIPE Atlas traceroute measurements (both IPv4 and IPv6) and generates a *.kml file.

* **[Rumy gem - API wrapper](https://github.com/EddyShure/ripe-atlas)** "ripe-atlas" is a minimalistic API wrapper for the RIPE Atlas API. It is written entirely in Ruby.
