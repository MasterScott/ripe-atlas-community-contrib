# RPKI Deployathon Amsterdam (Routing Security event)

In March 2019, we held a first [RPKI Deployathon in Amsterdam](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/becha/join-the-amsterdam-rpki-deployathon-2019) : an event simmilar to a hackathon,
but focused on BGP routing security. It was organised & supported by RIPE NCC, Juniper Networks & Tesuto (Lab).

Here you can find the material from the event: slides, documentation, and the booklet!
